# EthereumAbi

This is part of implementation of [ruby-ethereum](https://github.com/cryptape/ruby-ethereum)
that related to calculation of ABI Solidity contract calls for the EVM.

ABI stands for application binary interface.

In general, an ABI is the interface between two program modules, one of which is often at the level of machine code.
The interface is the de facto method for encoding/decoding data into/out of the machine code.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ethereum_abi'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ethereum_abi

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
